# Bike Share Project
Overview:
This project is an interactive and hands-on data analysis project designed to provide a practical experience in working with real-world data sets. The project revolves around the concept of bike-sharing systems, which have gained popularity in urban areas as a convenient and eco-friendly means of transportation. By participating in this project, I have the opportunity to apply their data analysis skills and gain valuable insights from large datasets obtained from bike share programs.

Objective:
The main objective of the Bike Share Project is to analyze the data collected from bike share systems to derive meaningful conclusions and insights. I have used  Python programming and data analysis libraries like NumPy and Pandas to explore the data, clean it, manipulate it, and extract valuable information from it. Through this hands-on project, I have worked with real-world datasets, implement data-wrangling techniques, and conduct exploratory data analysis.
